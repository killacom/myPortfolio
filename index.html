                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Thomas Porter. I work with small businesses to provide simple programming solutions. I am currently employed full time in sales but I really enjoy coding in my free time!</p>
                <p>I am 30 years old and I have been interested in computers and coding since before I was 10. At 6 my father helped me write my first program in BASIC. At 10 I created my first HTML web page in Microsoft Word complete with Word Art, clip art, and tables. At 12 I built my first PC (also with help from dad) with custom case, AMD processer, LED lights, and Windows 2000. It wasn't long before I learned about Macromedia Dreamweaver and started expirimenting on my own.</p>
                <p>In middle school when we were required to buy a Texas Instruments TI-83 (Mine was Plus Silver Edition) calculator for math class, I was excited to find out it was capable of programming. I promptly created formula applications on it for geometry class to easily calculate area, volume, etc... I also got caught playing games on it instead of doing my school work sometimes :)</p>
                <p>I created my first full functioning public website a year or two later. It was a site where people could download classic arcade games. I used html and PHP to make dynamic links to all the game files. In high school I got in trouble for making an "underground" website that I told all my friends about. It showed novice computer users how to get around the school website blocker using proxies. The school would constantly block the proxy address so I was always searching for and adding more to my database. It also had a PHP/MySQL message board for all the students to talk about how much they hated school. I was pulled out of class by a school resource office and told to take it down or I would be expelled!! XD</p>
                <p>I went on to read several books on different programming languages throughout the years while working in retail. I have made several small test applications and websites but I currently only have two ongoing projects (see below)</p>
                <p>I do not have any formal degrees or certificates but I am currently still teaching myself with classes on codecademy.com. I am a fast learner and I work well with others. </p>
