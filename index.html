                <p>Hello! My name is Thomas Porter. I work with small businesses to provide simple programming solutions. I am currently employed full time in sales but I really enjoy coding in my free time!</p>
                <p>I am 30 years old and I have been interested in computers and coding since before I can remember. I grew up in a family of computer guys (my grandfather worked on ENIAC) Before I was 10 my father helped me write my first program in BASIC. A short time after that I created my first HTML web page in Microsoft Word complete with Word Art, clip art, and tables. At 12 I built my first PC (also with help from dad) with custom case, AMD processer, LED lights, and Windows 2000. It wasn't long before I learned about Macromedia Dreamweaver and started expirimenting on my own.</p>
                <p>In middle school when we were required to buy a Texas Instruments TI-83 (Mine was Plus Silver Edition) calculator for math class, I was excited to find out it was capable of programming. I promptly created formula applications on it for geometry class to easily calculate area, volume, etc... I also got caught playing games on it instead of doing my school work sometimes!</p>
                <p>I created my first full functioning public website a year or two later. It was a site where people could download classic arcade games. I used html and PHP to make dynamic links to all the game files. In high school I got in trouble for making an "underground" website that I told all my friends about. It showed novice computer users how to get around the school website blocker using proxies. The school would constantly block the proxy address so I was always searching for and adding more to my database. It also had a PHP/MySQL message board for all the students to talk about school. I was pulled out of class by a school resource office and told to take it down or I would be expelled!!</p>
                <p>I have read several books on different programming languages throughout the years while working in retail. I have made several small test applications and websites but I currently only have two ongoing projects. (see below) I have done all aspects of my projects alone but I am willing to collaberate on larger projects.</p>
